This version of Sudoku contains all the features of classic Sudoku, including
easy, medium, and hard difficulties (as well as a secret difficulty or two)...
The game is accessible in both keyboard (although this require some
strategic placements) and mouse-only modes, and contains a 
total of 5 screens. The first screen functions as a main menu that allows the 
user to select their difficulty and mode, as well as navigate to the help menu 
(Screen 3) or create a custom board should they opt to. The second screen is
the main play screen where the user can enjoy their game of Sudoku, kitted with
hints, strong hints, undo, redo, clear, showing legals, banning, flagging,
and autofill options. The fourth and fifth screens are exclusive to a "special"
game mode...

The special game mode:

Has Sudoku ever felt a little bit boring? Doesn't it feel like it needs a little
kick to be exciting? Wouldn't it make sense for Sudoku to have a timer that 
forces users to think on their toes rather than mowing along slowly with all the
infinite time in the world we never had, and a punishment for thinking too slow?

Nightmare mode is accessible on the main menu exclusively through the keyboard,
although it can be played with the mouse after being selected. Due to time
 constraints, sound has not been implemented.
